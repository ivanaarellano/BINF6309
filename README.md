# BINF6309
#bp_kmers.py

# overview

This program reads the Drosophila genome file

Finds the k-mers of length 6 within each chromosome

Finds the k-mers that occur only once to a FASTA file named kmers.fasta

Uses Bio.SeqIO to write the unique k-mers to kmers.fasta

interleave.py
#overview:

This program reads two FASTQ files and interlaves them using SeqIO FASTA format

It takes the first four lines of the left read and then the first four lines of the right read

and so forth

Exports the interleaved file as Interleaved.fasta
